To customize them for yourself you may:

- clone repository to your profile;
- edit the `data.txt` file;
- access them via your url (like `http://youraccount.github.io/chinese-flash-cards`).

Data file format should contain chinese characters and description in every line, separated with `=` sign (and perhaps few spaces).
